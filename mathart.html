MathArt is a series of C++ scripts that I am making for creating mathematical artwork. It is high performance and multithreaded, and will support 2d and 3d functions as well as stochastic and dynamical systems.

<h2>Fractals</h2>
<p>
The mandelbrot set is the subset of the complex numbers given by
</p>
\[ \{ c \in \mathbb{C} : |f_c(0)|,|f_c^2(0)|,... \text{ is bounded} \}, \quad f_c(z)=z^2+c \]
<p>
More specifically, for rendering a mandelbrot one defines the mandelbrot function F as the number of iterations when it exceeds some massive number M
</p>

\[ F(c) = \min \{ k \in \mathbb{N} : |f_c^k(0)|>M \} \]

<p>
In fact, you can create mandelbrot variants with other functions such as
</p>

\[ f_c(z)=z \cos(z)+c \]

<p>
Which gives the fractal below

MathArt can render this "trigonometric mandelbrot" in 1080p in about 0.28 seconds. The standard mandelbrot in 1080p takes about 14 milliseconds (so ~70 frames per second). The coloring algorithm is automatically determined from a list of the three colors red, green, and blue.

I previously made an interactive web-based differential equation renderer <a href="https://patlsc.github.io/diffeq.html">https://patlsc.github.io/diffeq.html</a>, however its performance became stretched when doing massive (QHD, 4k, etc.) renders. Whereas the javascript one takes a few seconds for most images, this can render it in real time. The downside is that there is no GUI, but I aim to change this in the future.
